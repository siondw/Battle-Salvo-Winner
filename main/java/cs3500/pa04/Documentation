- A few notes about design decisions I made

    1. the game coordinates are 0-based index
    2. The flow of the game is like this - the GameController basically stores everything
        - it creates the boards based on the given inputs it gets
        - it then passes the players the boards that they need
        - it then controls how many time the model's game loop runs
        - and displays the boards after each iteration
    3. I made multiple classes for testing controller because it was easier to make before each methods
    4.
